## ðŸš€ Quick Development Setup

Use these convenient development scripts for easy setup and management:

```bash
# Full development setup (first time or when dependencies change)
./dev-start.sh      # Installs dependencies, builds, and runs with watch mode

# Quick start (when already built)
./dev-quick.sh      # Just starts the application (faster)

# Stop all development processes
./dev-stop.sh       # Stops watch processes and application
```

**What each script does:**
- `dev-start.sh`: Complete setup including dependency installation, React component building, TypeScript compilation with watch mode, and application launch
- `dev-quick.sh`: Quick application start (assumes project is already built)
- `dev-stop.sh`: Cleanly stops all development processes (watch builds and application)
