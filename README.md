AINative Studio is a powerful, open-source AI-Native development environment with built-in AI capabilities, forked from Void Editor and VS Code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Scripts

For developers working on AINative Studio, use these convenient scripts in the `ainative-studio/` directory:

```bash
cd ainative-studio

# Full development setup (first time or when dependencies change)
./dev-start.sh      # Installs dependencies, builds, and runs with watch mode

# Quick start (when already built)
./dev-quick.sh      # Just starts the application (faster)

# Stop all development processes
./dev-stop.sh       # Stops watch processes and application
```
