# Product Requirements Document: Documentation Improvement

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for improving the documentation of the AINative Studio project. The goal is to make the documentation more user-friendly, comprehensive, and accessible to new contributors.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary target audience for the improved documentation is new contributors to the AINative Studio project. The secondary audience is experienced developers who want to learn more about the project's architecture and development process.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a new contributor, I want to be able to quickly and easily set up my development environment so that I can start contributing to the project.
*   As a new contributor, I want to be able to find all the information I need to make my first contribution in one place so that I don't have to search through multiple files.
*   As a new contributor, I want to be able to understand the project's architecture and how the different components interact with each other so that I can make more meaningful contributions.
*   As an experienced developer, I want to be able to learn more about the project's development process so that I can contribute more effectively.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Consolidated `CONTRIBUTING.md`

*   Create a new, consolidated `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the `ainative-studio` directory.
*   This file will combine the information from the existing `CONTRIBUTING.md` files and will be the single source of truth for contribution guidelines.
*   The file should include the following sections:
    *   Code of Conduct
    *   How to Contribute
    *   Setting up the Development Environment
    *   Building the Project
    *   Running Tests
    *   Creating a Pull Request
    *   Coding Style and Conventions

### 4.2. "Getting Started" Guide

*   Create a new `GETTING_STARTED.md` file in the `ainative-studio` directory.
*   This file will be a user-friendly guide for new contributors.
*   The guide should walk them through the process of setting up their development environment, building the project, and making their first contribution.
*   It should also include links to the more detailed documentation, such as the `VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`.

### 4.3. Improved `VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md`

*   Update the `VOID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` with more diagrams and code examples.
*   Add a section on the project's architecture and how the different components interact with each other.

### 4.4. `DEVELOPMENT.md` file

*   Create a new `DEVELOPMENT.md` file in the `ainative-studio` directory.
*   This file will document the entire development process, from setting up the environment to running tests and creating a pull request.
*   It should also include a section on the project's coding style and conventions.

### 4.5. Updated `README.md` in `.devcontainer`

*   Update the `README.md` in the `.devcontainer` directory with a more general section on how to use the dev container with other editors.

## 5. Success Metrics

*   A decrease in the number of questions from new contributors about how to set up their development environment.
*   An increase in the number of first-time contributors to the project.
*   Positive feedback from the community on the improved documentation.
